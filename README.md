# Introduction

This project is my "second attempt" at creating a scripts that can automatically
pull in Twitter data and perform sentiment analysis. See my previous tweets repo
for more details regarding the origins of this project.

In this repo, I've primarily focused on NBA data. I've evaluated the tweets
from NBA team accounts, as well as a list of users who I believe represent "NBA Twitter"
(i.e. the "fun" online community of NBA fans). When analyzing the teams,
I've compared teams within NBA divisions for activity occurring over short amounts
of time (around 1 or 2 days). For NBA Twitter community, I've analyzed
how tweet content and sentiment changes from day to day.

See the `output/` folder in this repo for more details.
